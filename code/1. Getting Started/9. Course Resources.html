<p>All the source code shown in this course is made available for you to download.</p><p>You find it <strong>attached to multiple lectures per course module</strong> (reflecting the code state up to this lecture) and <strong>always to the last lecture of each module</strong> (contains all the code for the whole course section then).</p><p>Definitely use that code + compare it to yours if you're getting stuck or if you're facing issues - it should allow you to narrow down the issue and find out what's wrong.</p><p><strong>HOW TO USE THE ATTACHED CODE</strong></p><p>The attached code is always a snapshot of the project I'm working on in the course.</p><p>To run my code, simply extract the attached .zip files and navigate into the extracted folder with your terminal/ command prompt (via the <code>cd</code> command).</p><p>1) You then first need to install all dependencies via <code>npm install</code>.</p><p>2) Thereafter, start the development server via <code>npm run dev</code> - keep that process running until you're done with development</p><p><strong>ALTERNATIVELY</strong></p><p>Don't run my code but simply compare it (side by side or via a diffing tool) to your code.</p>
